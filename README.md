# Xbase Launcher
Plug-in for Eclipse/Xtext to launch via Xbase Editor's outline.

For unknown reasons Xtend doesn't enable the launching shortcut (Run As / Debug As) in the outline of the Xtend Editor. This plug-in provides the shortcut for any Xbase Editor.

## Usage

- Requires Xtend to be installed
- Open your language file (*.xtend, ...)
- Right-click on any node in the outline.
- Select: Run As/Debug As -> Java Application/JUnit Test
